<h1>Introduction to Machine Learning <span class="pull-right"><small>Fall 2016</small></span></h1>

<p>The course is a programming-focused introduction to Machine Learning. Increasingly, extracting value from data is an important contributor to the global economy across a range of industries. The field of Machine Learning provides the theoretical underpinnings for data-analysis as well as more broadly for modern artificial intelligence approaches to building artificial agents that interact with data; it has had a major impact on many real-world applications.</p>

<p>The course will emphasize understanding the foundational algorithms and “tricks of the trade” through implementation and basic-theoretical analysis. On the implementation side, the emphasis will be on practical applications of machine learning to computer vision, data mining, speech recognition, text processing, bioinformatics, and robot perception and control. Real data sets will be used whenever feasible to encourage understanding of practical issues.  The course will provide an opportunity for an open-ended research project. On the theoretical side, the course will give a undergraduate-level introduction to the foundations of machine learning topics including regression, classification, kernel methods, regularization, neural networks, graphical models, and unsupervised learning.</p>

            <p>The only enforced prerequisite is EECS 281.  However, we <b>strongly</b> recommend familiarity with at least two of the following:
            
            <ul>
                <li>Linear algebra at the level of MATH 419, preferrably at the level of MATH 217.</li>
                <li>Multivariable calculus at the level of MATH 215 or equivalent.</li>
                <li>Probability at the level of EECS 401, MATH 425, or equivalent.</li>
            </ul></p>
            
            <p>We understand that most EECS students will only ever encounter a proper subset of these topics, so we will be providing a <b>brief</b> review of <span style="color:red">important concepts</span> at the beginning of the semester.  We'll move fast, though, so be warned!</p>

            <p>This semester, we will be experimenting with a "flipped classroom" format.  The later section will be a typical lecture and will be video recorded for online viewing.  The earlier section will be a more hands-on format, where students will spend most of their time working in groups to better understand more challenging concepts together.</p>
