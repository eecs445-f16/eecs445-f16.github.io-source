Date:  Wednesday, September 14, 2016

Learning Objectives:

* Essential concepts in probability
    * You should be able to work with both discrete distributions AND continuous distributions.  Understand pdfs and cdfs.
    * What is the difference between a random variable and a distribution?
    * Independent random variables and events.
    * Common distributions and their properties (mean, variance, etc.)
        * Bernoulli
        * Binomial
        * Multinomial
        * Poisson
        * Categorical
        * Gaussian / Normal / Multivariate Normal
        * Beta
        * Dirichlet
    * Random vectors.  (Vectors whose elements are random variables)
    * Expectation, variance, and covariance of random variables.
    * Conditional expectation and variance.
    * Functions of random variables (compute expectation of functions of random variables, etc.)
    * Joint distributions.  Marginalization.  Marginal distributions.
    * Bayes' theorem.
    * Law of Total Probability
    * You should be comfortable with conditional probability.
    * Infinite sequences of random variables.
    * Basic understanding of likelihood
* Convex functions: definition and properties
* Constrained vs. unconstrained optimization
* Basic understanding of Lagrange duality
