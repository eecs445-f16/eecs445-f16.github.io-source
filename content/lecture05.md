Title:  Lecture 5. Linear Regression, Part II
Date: Wednesday, September 21, 2016

Learning Objectives:

* Overfitting and the need for regularization
    * Write the objective function for lasso and ridge regression
    * Use matrix calculus to find the gradient of the regularized objective
* Understand the probabilistic interpretation of linear regression
    * MLE formulation of linear regression objective
    * MAP formulation of regularized linear regression
        * Different priors correspond to different regularization
* Understand probabilistic modeling at a high level
    * Goals and assumptions of maximum likelihood estimation
    * Goals and assumptions of MAP estimation
    * Priors, likelihoods, and posteriors
