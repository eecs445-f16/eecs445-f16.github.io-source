Title:  Lecture 02, Linear Algebra Review
Date: Monday, September 12, 2016

Learning Objectives:

* Basic matrix operations.  You should be able to interpret all of these geometrically AND write down generic formulas for each.
    * Vector addition, subtraction, and scaling.
    * Matrix-vector multiplication, and interpretations in terms of the rows and columns of the matrix.
    * Matrix-matrix multiplication, and interpretations.
    * Dot products, including how they relate to projections and the angle between vectors.  More generally, inner products.
    * Projection onto a vector or onto a subspace.
    * Matrix transposes.  Transpose of products, transpose of sums.
* Basic Matrix Properties
    * Understand the rank of a matrix both algebraically and geometrically.  What does it mean for a matrix to have full rank?
    * Be able to describe the image and kernel of a matrix using set notation.
    * Know all of the common equivalent conditions for a matrix to be invertible, in terms of the eigenvalues, the columns, the determinant, etc..
* Vector spaces
    * Definition of an abstract vector space / subspace.
    * Definition of linearly independent vectors
    * Definition of basis, span, and dimension
    * Orthogonality and orthogonal / orthonormal bases
    * Know how to compute the coordinate vector for an element of an abstract vector space, with respect to a known basis.
    * Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
    * Know what a linear transformation is.
* Norms
    * Definition of a norm, and the properties that every norm must satisfy.
    * Understand and interpret geometrically the 1-norm, 2-norm, and infinity-norms.  More generally, the p-norms.  
* Special matrices.  Know the properties and common use cases for each.  For example, what can we say about the eigenvalues/eigenvectors for each special matrix below?  How do we multiply these matrices or take powers?  What can we say about the rank?
    * Symmetric / Hermitian matrices.  
    * Orthogonal / unitary matrices
    * Diagonal matrices
    * Triangular matrix
    * Positive-definite and positive-semidefinite matrices
* Eigenvalues / eigenvectors
    * Geometric interpretation
    * Matrix diagonalization.  Which matrices are diagonalizable and how can you tell?
    * Spectral theorem
* Singular value decomposition
    * Geometric interpretation (the image of the unit circle under every matrix is a hyperellipse)
    * What does the SVD look like for the special matrices listed above?
    * How can we interpret the singular values?
    * How does the SVD relate to the rank of a matrix?
